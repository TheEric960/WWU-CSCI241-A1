Hello! This is [todo] grading your A1.

Your total score is 48 / 50

The point breakdown is given in the sections below, corresponding to the
rubric given on the A1 handout.

===================================
Repository and submission mechanics
===================================
1 / 1 point:
Code is pushed to github and hours spent appear as a lone integer in hours.txt



======================
Sorts.java Correctness
======================

Your Sorts.java was tested using unit tests by running gradle test. Each of the
20 tests is worth 1 point. The tests for this assignment were the same tests as
you were given, except with the random number generator seed changed so that
the random arrays have different values. The output of the gradle test command
is included in grading_outputs/unittests.txt; please see this file for details.

18 / 20

=========================
SortsDriver.java Behavior
=========================

1 / 1 Prompts user for number of integers desired
1 / 1 Prompts for type of sort to run (m, i, q, a)
1 / 1 Uses a random number generator to populate arrays

3 / 3 Each invocation of a sort correctly tallies the count of comparisons made.

2 / 2 The a option invokes all four sorts and gives them the same input array

2 / 2 Pre-sorted and sorted array(s) are printed if and only if n <= 20.

==========
Efficiency
==========

2 / 2 Mergesort runs in O(n log n)

2 / 2 QuickSort runs in O(n log n) in the expected case

2 / 2 Insertion sort runs in-place, and runs O(n2).

2 / 2 Radix makes a constant number of O(n) passes over the input.
